Identification numbers range from 1-30.- Data from column 1 is copied to column 2.- Column 1 is filled with the text “test_set” to identify that the data is from the test set of data.- Column 3 is populated with associated activities by converting the activity identification code (which ranges from 1-7) and translating it into an associated textual description.  - Columns 4-9 are populated with accelerometer mean and standard deviation data in x-y-z order.Transform Script (train data set)- Subject identification data is read from raw data file.- Training activity identification data is read from raw data file.- Training result data (accelerometer mean and standard deviation) is read from data file.- Data frame created for consolidation and manipulation of data.- Column 1 created with a list of all subject identification numbers.  Identification numbers range from 1-30.- Data from column 1 is copied to column 2.- Column 1 is filled with the text “train_set” to identify that the data is from the test set of data.- Column 3 is populated with associated activities by converting the activity identification code (which ranges from 1-7) and translating it into an associated textual description.  - Columns 4-9 are populated with accelerometer mean and standard deviation data in x-y-z order.Transformation script for combined data- The test data and the training data frames are combined.- The combined data frame is sorted based on the subject identification number.- The subject identification number is converted from an integer to a factor.The transformed data set is composed of the following columns:1 – Activity set (Test or Train)2 – Subject identification number (a factor variable between 1 – 30)3 – Activity description (Walking, Walking_upstairs, Walking_downstairs, Sitting, Standing, or Laying)4-6 – Mean Accelerometer data (g’s) for X, Y, and Z axes.7-9 – Standard Deviation of acceleration readings (g’s squared) for X, Y, and Z axes.The results are written to a .csv and .txt file titled “tidy_HAR_dataset”.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Calculate the means for each subject and activity from the tidy dataset (tidy_HAR_means.R)The Aggregate function is used on the data frame containing the tidy data set to calculate the means using subject and activity columns to subset the data.The results are written to a .csv and .txt file titled “tidy_HAR_means” and returned to the calling function.
