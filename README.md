Cleaning_data
This repository contains the information to manipulate the data from the UCI HAR dataset
and convert it to a tidy data frame.  Additionally, the resulting tidy data is then processed
further to calculate the mean for each value for each subject/activity combination.

This repository has 7 files:
1) The raw data
2) A Codebook describing the conversion of the data
3) Two script files to convert the data
