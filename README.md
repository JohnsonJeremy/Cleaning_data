Cleaning_data

This repository contains the information to manipulate the data from the UCI HAR dataset
and convert it to a tidy data frame.  Additionally, the resulting tidy data is then processed
further to calculate the mean for each value for each subject/activity combination.

This repository has 6 files:

1) This readme.md file
2) The raw data
3) A Codebook describing the conversion of the data (codebook.docx)
4) A script file (tidy_har_data.R) to convert the raw data to a tidy data set.
5) A script file (tidy_har_means.R) to use the tidy data to calculate the means.

6) The resulting tidy dataset (tidy_HAR_dataset.csv)

7) The resutling means calculation (tidy_HAR_means.csv)
