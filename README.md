Cleaning_data

This repository contains the information to manipulate the data from the UCI HAR dataset
and convert it to a tidy data frame.  Additionally, the resulting tidy data is then processed
further to calculate the mean for each value for each subject/activity combination.

The source of the data can be found at:  
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This repository has 5 files:

1) This readme.md file

2) A Codebook describing the conversion of the data (codebook.docx)

3) A script file (run_analysis.R) to convert the raw data to a tidy data set and perfrom calculation of subject/activity means..

4) The resulting tidy dataset (tidy_HAR_dataset.csv)

5) The resutling means calculation (tidy_HAR_means.csv)
